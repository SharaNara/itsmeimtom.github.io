<p>Hello! My name is Thomas, but it's easier to write Tom. This is my (superfluous) home on the internet.</p>

<p>Currently I'm studying IT and taking a bunch of certifications along with it. Maybe one day I'll have a CV linked here.</p>

<p>I used to write a <a href="/blog/">blog</a> but I'm not creative enough to keep it updated at all, so I got rid of it from the menu.<br>You're better off following my Twitter where I complain about things like an old man and autistically nerd out about trains.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Brief FaQ</h2>

<h4 id="tech">Please tell me every piece of technology you own</h4>
<p>That's not a question but <a href="/uses">okay, can do</a>.</p>

<h4 id="lowercase">What's with the baby pictures?</h4>
<p>why not? ._.</p>

<h4 id="gradient">What's that gradient at the top of the page for?</h4>
<p>It's the same colours as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexual_pride_flag">bi flag</a>.</p>

<h4 id="dnomaid">What is a dnomaid.co.uk?</h4>
<p>It's "diamond" (from <a href="https://archive.trobinson.me/diamondpigman.co.uk/">here</a>) backwards. The domain is still used for emails but nothing else.</p>

<h4 id="tommy">Are you Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon?</h4>
<p>No, although I think he picked a nice alias to go by. I'm also not a basketballer, footballer or politician &mdash; turns out it's a pretty common name.</p>
